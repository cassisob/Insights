# Insights Project

> "The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight." — Carly Fiorina

## 1. Introduction

This project is designed to demonstrate the process of generating valuable business insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to recommend actionable solutions for a business by following a structured data science methodology.

## 2. Project Objective

The objective of the Insights Project is to provide solutions to business problems through insights derived from comprehensive data analysis. This project focuses on five key steps of the data science problem-solving roadmap:

1. Business Question
2. Business Understanding
3. Data Collection
4. Data Cleaning
5. Data Exploration

## 3. Challenge Context

### 3.1 House Rocket Company

**Disclaimer:** The context provided is entirely fictional, including the company, scenario, CEO, and business questions.

House Rocket is a digital platform specializing in buying and selling real estate using technology. As a Data Scientist hired by House Rocket, your task is to identify the best business opportunities in the real estate market to maximize the company's revenue.

### 3.2 Business Problem

House Rocket's primary strategy is to purchase properties in excellent locations at low prices and later sell them at higher prices. The greater the difference between the purchase and sale prices, the higher the company's profit and revenue. However, various attributes influence property attractiveness, including location and time of year.

### 3.3 Business Questions

This project focuses on answering the following questions:

1. Which houses should the CEO of House Rocket buy, and at what purchase price?
2. Once the company owns a house, what is the best time to sell it, and at what sale price?
3. Should House Rocket renovate the house to increase the sale price? If so, what are the suggested changes, and what is the price increment for each renovation option?

### 3.4 Dataset

The dataset representing this context is available on [House Sales Prediction Dataset](https://github.com/cassisob/Insights/blob/main/kc_house_data.csv). This dataset contains information about houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015, which will be used to develop the solution.
